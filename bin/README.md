In order to run the game client and dedicated server, unzip the content of `libs.zip` and use dedicated *.bat scripts (they configure the connection properties such as client/server ip, server port, web server address).

Multiple clients can be connected to the same game server instance (by starting `run_game_client_logic.bat` multiple times).
